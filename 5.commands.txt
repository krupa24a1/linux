Previous notes

~ => Home directory
/ => Root directory

Print working directory
> pwd

list folders and files
> ls
Displays files in that specified path.
> ls <path>
Lists directories recursively
-> ls -r <path>
List all files including hidden files
> ls -a <path> 

change directory
> cd <path>
2 dots -> represents previous directory
1 dot -> represents present directory

rmdir <directoryName>

File operations
============
To create a file
> touch <fileName>
To remove a file
> rm <fileName>

rm -d <directoryName> || rmdir <directoryName>
To remove an non-empty directory and all files in it
> rm -r <directoryName>

clear

Note
====
Everything in linux is a file
-> Text documents, pictures etc
-> Directories
-> Commands like pwd, ls etc (binaries)
-> Devices like mouse, printer, keyboard etc 
We can work with all of them just as we work with files.

Navigating in the file system (cd)
===========================
absolute path: complete path of a location
relative path: path of a location from current location

More file and directory operations
============================
Renaming a file or dir
> mv <fileOrDirName> <newFileOrDirName>
moving files
> mv <fileOrDirName> <dirName>
Copying files or directories
> cp <fileName> <newFileName>
> cp -r <dirName> <newDirName>  copy contents recursively (-r)

> history 
gives list of all past commands we typed in current terminal session

Search on CLI 
> ctrl + r -> search history
Stop current command
> ctrl + c
copy text
> ctrl + shift + c
Paste copied text to terminal 
> ctrl + shift + v

Display contents of a file (cat means concatenate)
> cat <fileName>

Display OS info
============
Show system and kernel
> uname -a 
About cpu 
> lscpu
About memory
> lsmem

Execute commands as super user
============================
sudo => allows regular users to run programs with the security privileges of the superuser or root.
> sudo adduser admin
> sudo addgroup devops
> su - admin   =>  to switch to different user
