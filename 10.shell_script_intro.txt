What is shell script?
=====================
=> It is a file that contains a bunch of shell commands that we want to execute.
=> The file has an extension of .sh
=> The first line of the file will be shebang line.
=> E.g: #!/bin/bash
=> Rest of the file contains the commands that we want to execute.
=> We can execute file with ./<filename>
=> E.g: ./sample.txt

Why do we need shell script?
============================
Till now we have executed commands one by one on terminal simply by typing one after the other.
=> What if we want to store the history of those commands?
=> What if we want to share those commands to others?
=> What if there are bulk operations?
=> What if there are logics?
=> What if we want to execute same set of commands on different servers?
In all the above cases, typing out each and every command manually on terminal would be tidious.
So, the solution is 
=> Simply type in all those commands in a file.
=> Share this file to others.
=> Bulk operations can be done using programming constructs.
=> Logics can also be written inside file.
=> We can execute same file on multiple servers.

What is a Shell?
================
=> Shell is a program that interprets the commands that we write so that kernel can understand and execute them.
=> Every unix like systems such as linux and macos has default shell called Bourne shell.
1) Bourne shell /bin/sh
2) Bash Shell /bin/bash
	- Bourne Again Shell
	- Improved version of default Bourne shell.
3) ZSH Shell /bin/zsh
etc etc.,
=> Every shell is a programming language.
=> We can write logic, commands and do bulk operations with it.

sample.txt
==========
#! /bin/bash
echo "Linux is cool!"

Execute sample.txt
==================
1) ./sample.txt
2) <shell name> sample.txt
	- e.g: bash sample.txt

Add execution permission
========================
sudo chmod u+x sample.txt

Why we need shebang line? 
=========================
=> #! /bin/bash
=> There are various shell programs present in the system.
=> How the system knows which shell should execute the shell script?
=> The path to that shell is given in the start of the file which is called shebang line.
