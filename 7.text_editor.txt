Most of the linux distributions have a text editor named vi/vim which is integrated to terminal.
vim is a updated version of vi.

why to use vi?
==============
-> Simple to read contents of a file
-> Easy to edit contents of a file
-> We can create, read, edit any kind of file
-> In servers, we don't have gui, in those cases having an editor like vim would be best to edit text files

VIM
===
-> sudo apt install vim
-> vim testing.txt
There are two modes in vim
1) Command mode 
-> This is the default mode
-> We can't edit the text in this mode
-> Whatever we type is interpreted as  a command
-> Navigate, search, undo, delete etc
2) Insert mode
-> Allows us to enter text

Switch to insert mode - press character "I" on keyboard
Switch to command mode - press "esc" character on keyboard 
:wq - write and quit
:q! - quit without saving changes

dd       - to delete a line 
d10d     - to delete 10 lines
u        - undo
A        - shift to end of line and switch to insert mode
$        - shift to end of line without switching to insert mode
0        - jump to beginning of line
10G      - jump to 10th line
/pattern - search for pattern
   n - to jump to next match
   N - jump to previous match
:%s/oldstring/newstring - replace oldstring with newstring throughout the file
