Pipes (|):
==========
Passing stadard output of one command as a standard input of another command.

There are 3 standard i/o streams
================================
1) Standard Input (0)
2) Standard Output (1)
3) Standard Error (2)
There is one stadard input stream and two standard output streams(standard output and standard error).

pipe usecases?
==============
1) less - When we want to display large contents in an interactive mode by not filling up the terminal then less command is used.
=> space - to go to next page
=> b - to go to previous page
=> q - to quit from interactive mode
cat /var/log/syslog | less
ls /sbin | less
history | less
2) grep
=> globally search for a regular expression
=> It searches for a given pattern or sequence of characters in the input we give and returns all the lines that match the pattern.
ls /sbin | grep adduser
history | grep "sudo chmod"

=> We can redirect grep commands standard output as input to less command if it is too large.
history | grep rm | less

Redirects (>, >>, 2>)
=====================
=> If we want to store standard output of a command into a file, we use redirect(>).
history | grep grep > grep_commands.txt
=> If we want to append standard output of a command to a file with content, we use redirect (>>).
history | grep less >> grep_commands.txt
=> If we want to store standard error into a file, we use 2>. 2 is the code that represents standard error.
madir 2> error.txt

We can take standard input from a file using "<" operator.
