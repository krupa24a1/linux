There are 3 types of users or accounts in a system
1) Super user account
=> Only on account per system.
=> Also called root user.
=> Has all privileges and access.
2) User account
=> Standard or regular user.
=> We create this type of account in order to login to system and perform tasks.
=> Each system can have multiple regular user accounts.
=> We can run commands as super user by prefixing command with word sudo.
3) Service account
=> Linux distributions have various servers.
=> Each server is running a service.
=> The service should not run with root user as it may cause some security issues because root user is having all privileges.
=> E.g: To run postgresql service, a postgres service account is created.

Why multiple user accounts?
=> In windows we have a centralized user management system which manages all users.
=> Those users can login to any hardware if that system is connected to that central system.
=> In linux, we don't have that central system.
=> We can only have multiple user accounts dedicated to that particular hardware.

Users and Permissions
=====================
Permissions can be assigned at 
1) User level
2) Group level
=> Assigning permissions to each and every user can be tidious.
=> We can create groupes, assign permissions to it and then add users to that group.
=> If we want to revoke permissions from user, we can simply remove user from that group.
E.g: Groups like devops, admin, developers. Add users to each group. Assign permissions to group.

Where all these permisisons are stored?
=======================================
1) /etc/passwd
=> Stored user account information.
=> Every user can read but only super user can edit the file.
krupa:x:1000:1000:krupa,,,:/home/krupa:/bin/bash
=> krupa - username with which the user logs in.
=> x - x means the password is encrypted and it is Stored in /etc/shadow.
=> 1000 - Each user has a unique ID. UID 0 is reserved for root.
=> 1000 - Primary Group ID of that user. It is stored in /etc/group.
=> krupa,,, - User ID info. Comment field for extra information about users.
=> /home/krupa - home directory of that user.
=> /bin/bash - default shell of that user.

How to add user?
================
sudo adduser <username>
=> Automatically chooses policy-conformant UID and GID values.
=> Automatically creates a home directory with skeletal configuration.
=> It creates a user with the given name and assigns UID.
=> Also creates a group with the same name as username and assigns GID.

How to change password?
=======================
passwd <username>

How to login with other user account?
=====================================
su - <username> => to login as other regular user.
su - => to login as root user.
=> su means substitute or switch user.

How to add new group
====================
sudo groupadd devops
=> By default, system assigns next available GID from the range of Group IDs specified in the login.defs file.
=> All groupes info is found in /etc/group.
devops:x:1002:
=> devops: group name
=> x: means, the password is encrypted and stored in /etc/shadow
=> 1002: GID of that group
=> last fields consists of the list of users that are part of that group.

Different user and group commands
=================================
=> adduser, useradd
=> addgroup, groupadd
adduser and addgroup
====================
=> Interactive.
=> More user friendly.
=> It chooses conformant UID, GUID values for you.
=> Creates a home directory with skeletal config automatically.
=> Or asks for input in interactive mode.
useradd and groupadd
====================
=> We need to provide information ourself.
=> Low-level utilities.

Which one to use?
=================
=> Use useradd, groupadd - when executing in an automated way i.e., scripts.
=> Use adduser, addgroup - when executing them manually.
=> Sample applies for deluser, delgroup and userdel, groupdel.

How to change primary group of an user?
=======================================
=> sudo usermod [options] <username> : modify a user account
sudo usermod -g <groupname> <username>
e.g: sudo usermod -g devops krupa
=> A user can be a part of one primary group and multiple secondary groupes.
=> -G flag is used to add user to multiple secondary groups.
=> -G overrides existing secondary groups list.
=> -aG appends new secondary group to existing secondary groups list.
e.g: sudo usermod -G admin krupa
e.g: sudo usermod -aG developer krupa

Print groups that a user part of
================================
groups => gives list of secondary groups that currently logged in user is part of.
groups demo => gives list of secondary groups that specified user is part of.

Add user to group at the time of user creation
==============================================
sudo useradd -G devops krupa
=> The low level command compared to adduser
=> -G is used to add user to multiple secondary groups.
=> -d is used to add custom home directory.
=> Other options for shell etc

Remove user from a group
========================
sudo gpasswd -d krupa devops

Permissions
===========
Each directory and file has permissions for user, group and others.

ls -l : Displays long list which shows permissions
ls -la : includes hidden files and folders as well

There are 3 types of permissions.
1) Read
2) Write
3) Execute

e.g: -rw-rw-r-- 1 krupa developer  1527 May 14 15:34 1.intro_devops
     drwxrwxr-x 8 krupa developer  4096 May 15 21:19 .git

-/d : - means its is a file and d means it is a directory

rw-/rwx : first set of permissions indicate the permissions the owner of that file having on that file. Here in this case the owner of the file 1.intro_devops and .git folder is krupa. She is having read, write permissions on that file and all 3 permissions on that folder.

rw-/rws : second set of permissions indicate the permissions the primary group of the owner of that file or folder.

r--/r-x : third set of permission indicate the permissions of the users that are not part of owner of that file and primary group of the owner of that file.

- : when it is present in place of read, write or execute permission, that means that particular permission is absent for that user or group or others.

r : read permission

w : write permission

x : execute permission
  

How to change owner or owner's primary group of a file or folder?
=================================================================
e.g: -rw-rw-r-- 1 krupa developer  5018 May 15 21:19 8.users_permissions.txt

sudo chown krupamani:devops 8.users_permissions.txt
	- changes both owner and owner group of that file
sudo chown krupamani 8.users_permissions.txt
	- changes only the owner of that file
sudo chgrp devops 8.users_permissions.txt
	- changes only the owner group of that file

How to change permissions of a file or folder?
==============================================
1) Symbolic mode
	- r read
	- w write 
	- x execute
	- - no permission
	- + add
	- - remove
2) Set permissions: set the permission and override the permissions set earlier.
3) Numeric mode 
	- 4 read
	- 2 write
	- 1 execute
	- 0 no permission

1) Symbolic mode 
e.g: -rw-rw-r-- 1 krupa developer  5018 May 15 21:19 8.users_permissions.txt
sudo chmod u+x 8.users_permissions.txt - add execute permission to user
sudo chmod u-r 8.users_permissions.txt - remove read permission from user
sudo chmod g-w 8.users_permissions.txt - remove write permission to group
sudo chmod o+x 8.users_permissions.txt - add execute permission to others
sudo chmod o+a 8.users_permissions.txt - add all permissions to others
sudo chmod g-a 8.users_permissions.txt - remove all permissions from group

2) Set permissions
e.g: -rw-rw-r-- 1 krupa developer  5018 May 15 21:19 8.users_permissions.txt
sudo chmod u=-wx 8.users_permissions.txt - write, execute permissions to user
sudo chmod g=r-- 8.users_permissions.txt - read permission for group
sudo chmod o=r-x 8.users_permissions.txt - read, execute permissions to others

3) Numeric mode
0 - no permissions
1 - execute
2 - write
3 - write, execute
4 - read
5 - read, execute
6 - read, write
7 - read, write execute

sudo chmod 777 8.users_permissions.txt - add all permissions to all users
sudo chmod 000 8.users_permissions.txt - remove all permissions from all users
sudo chmod 753 8.users_permissions.txt - all permissions to owner, read-execute permissions to group, write-execute permission to others.
